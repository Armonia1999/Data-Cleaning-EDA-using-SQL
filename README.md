# Data-Cleaning-EDA-using-SQL

In this project we analyse a dataset we got from 'Real World Fake Data' using SQL then we visualize it using Tableau.

The link to the dataset : https://data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data/workspace/file?filename=Call+Center.csv

note: They have awesome datasets ! so feel free to choose whatever dataset you want from it, I picked the call-center one.

Steps we did :
* Download the csv file.
* Import the file to MySQL
* Clean it a bit (since it's pretty clean to start with)
* Perform EDA
* Visualize it using Tableau.
